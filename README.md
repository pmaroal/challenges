# JavaScript Challenges

## Description

In this repository, I will be compiling the various JavaScript challenges that I solve as I progress in learning this programming language.

My goal is to create a personal portfolio that showcases my progress and skills in JavaScript. Each challenge will have its own `.js` file in the repository, and I will add a brief description of each one in the README.

## Table of Contents

As I add more challenges, I will list them here with links to their respective files.
